          Manufacturers design solar panels to last for decades. According to

            href="https://www.seia.org/initiatives/recycling-end-life-considerations-photovoltaics#:~:text=Photovoltaic%20panels%20are%20designed%20to,be%20upwards%20of%2010%20years.">Solar
            Energy Industries Association (SEIA)</a>, solar panels last between 20 and 30
          years. Some well-made panels
          may even last up to 40 years. Though solar panels won’t simply stop
          working after 25 years, their power production and efficiency will
          decline, meaning they’ll be less effective at converting the sun’s
          energy into power for your home. This decline in effectiveness is
          known as the solar panel degradation rate.
